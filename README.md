Since the death of RobCole.com, many who uses Rob Cole's Lightroom plugin cannot access the tools he created. Since his license allows us to redistribute his code, let's share his legacy.

[^1]: The license in this repo is currently from [RawPlusJpeg/RawPlusJpeg.LICENSE.txt at master Â· atramos/RawPlusJpeg](https://github.com/atramos/RawPlusJpeg/blob/master/RawPlusJpeg.LICENSE.txt). While I don't think RobCole used different licenses for different plugins, technically we need the license for this particular plugin.
